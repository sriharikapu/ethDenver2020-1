A simple market for buying and selling shares in candidates during the primary election process. 

There is no central order book or matching engine. Users buy or sell shares from a central counterparty.

The dApp is meant for small groups of people, e.g. in an office pool. The number of available shares per candidate and the initial credit balance per canddate can be adjusted according the size of the user base.

Keeping the total number of shares fixed encorages diverse strategies, e.g. put all your money in your favored candidate vs. hedge across multiple candidates.

As the primary process goes on, the administrator logs outcomes according to which points are assgned to the users.

The leader at the end of the primary process wins the game.

The smart contracts were written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain using Remix.

The dApp was crated using DappHero: https://admin.dapphero.io/publicprojectpage/1581818095100x340910386771132400
